# Todo Application

This is a simple Todo application built using Vite, React, Redux Toolkit, and CSS. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding new todos, marking them as done, and deleting them. Completed tasks will be shown at the bottom with a crossed line, and newly created ones will be shown at the top of the list. The application follows the principles of a typical Todo list, providing users with a straightforward interface to organize their tasks effectively.
